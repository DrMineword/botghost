We use them to extract different digits from the timestamp.  Dividing by powers of 10 shifts the digits to the right, and the modulo operator (`% 2`) gives the remainder after dividing by 2 (which is either 0 or 1).\n* **`floor()`:** This rounds the result down to the nearest integer, ensuring we get a 0 or 1.\n* **Concatenation:** The individual 0s and 1s are implicitly concatenated together by placing the expressions next to each other.\n\n\n**To increase the length:**\n\nAdd more sections like this, each dividing by a progressively smaller power of 10:\n\n```\n{solve_equation[floor(({time_now_unix}/100000000000)%2)]} ...\n```\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Length Limit:** BotGhost might have a limit on the maximum length of a single variable expression. If your desired length `[LENGTH]` is too large, you might need to break it into multiple variables and concatenate them using other BotGhost features (if available).\n* **Randomness:** While this uses the timestamp, the resulting binary string isn\u0027t truly random. It\u0027s pseudo-random, determined by the current time.  For true randomness, you\u0027d need a different approach (if BotGhost supports a random number generator that\u0027s not tied to the timestamp).\n\nRemember to replace `[LENGTH]` with your desired length and adjust the divisors accordingly.  If you need a longer string, you will need to break this into multiple variables and concatenate them using a method supported by BotGhost.  The provided example is the most efficient single-line solution within the constraints of the BotGhost variable system.\n"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE"},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE"},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE"},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE"}],"avgLogprobs":-0.1336788402884833}],"usageMetadata":{"promptTokenCount":58019,"candidatesTokenCount":897,"totalTokenCount":58916,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":58019}],"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":897}]},"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-flash"}},{"type":"metadata","iso-req":"2025-03-22 15:39:17","lng":3075,"id":"o1v87LjEHTdSzF3B6I5CxBJ6A3T51PqF4Zy"}]
