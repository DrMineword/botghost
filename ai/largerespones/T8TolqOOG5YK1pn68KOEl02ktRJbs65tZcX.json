The hexadecimal characters in a UUID (0-9, a-f) require a larger character set than a simple numerical collection can provide.  To generate a UUID-like string, you would need a much larger collection containing all the necessary hexadecimal characters.  Even then, constructing the string without concatenation would be extremely inefficient and impractical.\n\nThe `concat` function, while not currently working as expected, is the most logical and efficient way to build a string from multiple parts in BotGhost.  Until `concat` is fixed, I cannot fulfill your request completely.  I strongly recommend waiting for a fix to the `concat` function or suggesting an alternative approach to the BotGhost developers.\n"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE"},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE"},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE"},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE"}],"avgLogprobs":-0.26757746349180367}],"usageMetadata":{"promptTokenCount":59650,"candidatesTokenCount":173,"totalTokenCount":59823,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":59650}],"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":173}]},"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-flash"}},{"type":"metadata","iso-req":"2025-03-18 20:32:42","lng":867,"id":"T8TolqOOG5YK1pn68KOEl02ktRJbs65tZcX"}]
