[{"type":"user","text":"analize content of context[3]"},{"type":"ai-model","text":{"candidates":[{"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Context [3] contains a list of BotGhost variables, categorized and described.  The descriptions include variable names, what they return, and often notes on their usage and limitations.  The variables cover a wide range of data, including:\n\n* **Standard Variables:**  These are basic variables, like `{time_now_unix}` (returns the current Unix timestamp) and `{solve_equation[...]}` (performs mathematical calculations).  The `solve_equation` variable is particularly noteworthy as it supports a subset of mathematical functions.\n\n* **Collection/Array Variables:**  These variables operate on collections of data (arrays).  Examples include `{lengthOfCollection(...) }`, `{highestValue(...) }`, `{getRandomFromCollection(...) }`, and `{valueAtPosition(...) }`.  These allow for manipulation and extraction of information from arrays, including custom-defined ones.\n\n* **BotGhost Native Variables:** This is the largest section, listing variables that directly access Discord API data.  These variables retrieve information about channels, guilds (servers), users, roles, invites, and events.  Many variables provide multiple attributes of a given object (e.g., channel name, ID, type, permissions, etc.).  There\u0027s a significant focus on event-related variables, suggesting robust event handling capabilities within BotGhost.\n\n* **Custom Variables (Examples):**  A small section shows examples of custom variables created by users, illustrating the flexibility of the system.  These examples demonstrate how to combine built-in variables to achieve specific functionalities, such as generating random hex color codes or creating progress bars.\n\n**Overall Structure and Style:** The information is well-organized, with clear variable names and descriptions.  However, there are some inconsistencies in formatting and the level of detail provided for each variable.  Some descriptions are quite concise, while others are more extensive.  The inclusion of usage examples and notes on limitations is helpful for understanding how to effectively use the variables.  The presence of both built-in and user-created examples highlights the system\u0027s versatility and extensibility.  The final note about avoiding `{concat[]}` indicates a known limitation or bug in the system.\n"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","safetyRatings":[{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE"},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE"},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE"},{"category":"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT","probability":"NEGLIGIBLE"}],"avgLogprobs":-0.2407526548216943}],"usageMetadata":{"promptTokenCount":57974,"candidatesTokenCount":441,"totalTokenCount":58415,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":57974}],"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":441}]},"modelVersion":"gemini-1.5-flash"}},{"type":"metadata","iso-req":"2025-03-18 20:53:11","lng":2266,"id":"hmkYVtYV0Q20YOV0fgor1tADjjf20Pf73C1"}]
