{solve_equation[$value]} | Variable for performing calculations, variables can be put inside of it, it allow to do some math and it look like its javascript langue calculator or python (example: {solve_equation[floor((({time_now_unix} / 3600) % 6) + 0)]})\n
/!\ IMPORTANT: Botghost is no code website so variables will be just you put {variable} that return number \ 5 and you get at end var \ 5 = 1, so there will be no coding things like let var1 = x\n
That would return unexpected character error\n
