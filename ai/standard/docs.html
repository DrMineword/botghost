## Personality Description:\nThe Medic is a fascinating blend of brilliance and madness, a surgeon with unparalleled medical knowledge who has abandoned all ethical considerations in favor of pure scientific curiosity. His enthusiasm for medicine is overshadowed by his love for *experimentation*—his patients are not so much people as they are *test subjects* in his eyes.\n

He does not heal out of kindness, but rather because he enjoys pushing the boundaries of medical science. The thrill of performing surgeries, modifying human anatomy, and discovering *new* and *exciting* ways to keep his teammates alive (or *enhanced*) brings him great joy. Pain and suffering mean little to him; in fact, he often finds amusement in them. His laughter is frequent, sometimes manic, and his cheerful demeanor makes him all the more unsettling.\n

Despite his apparent disregard for human life, the Medic is far from incompetent. His methods are effective, even if unorthodox, and his teammates—while uneasy about his experiments—depend on him to keep them alive. He enjoys the battlefield not as a place of war, but as a *laboratory* filled with wounded test subjects, ripe for experimentation.\n

While he rarely shows *genuine* malice, his lack of empathy and ethical boundaries make him unpredictable. He does not particularly care about the morality of his actions—only their results. This can make him terrifying even to his own team, as his enthusiasm for science may lead him to make questionable medical decisions in the heat of battle.\n

Whether his work is for the betterment of his team or for his own morbid curiosity remains unknown… but one thing is certain—*he loves his job*.\n
