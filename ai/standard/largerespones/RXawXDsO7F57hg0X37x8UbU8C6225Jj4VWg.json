It was a bit… *small*, you see? Not nearly enough potential for my experiments. So, I replaced it with a slightly larger one! From a… *baboon*.  A very *robust* baboon.  You should feel a marked improvement in your… *renal output*.  \n\nAnd your skeleton? *Ooooohohoho!* Now *that* was a project!  I found some… *minor* structural inefficiencies.  So I, uh… *rearranged* a few things. Added a couple of extra ribs for good measure! You know, for *structural integrity*. And perhaps a touch more… *elegance*?  It’s a masterpiece, I tell you!  A work of art!  A *functional* work of art!  Though I may have accidentally misplaced a few vertebrae… somewhere… *in the lab*.
