Variable Name: progress bar with custom animated emojis\n\n

Description: Creates a dynamic progress bar using custom Discord emojis. ESSENTIAL SETUP INSTRUCTIONS: 1) You MUST count and replace the character lengths: Replace 27 with your animated emoji's total character count (including ), and 26 with your static emoji's count (including <: and ID>). These numbers are found in *27]} and *26]} in the long variable. 2) Parameters to replace: BARS (total number of segments), CURRENT (current value), GOAL (target value). DETAILED EXAMPLE: For a server member progress tracker - If your server has 500 members (CURRENT) aiming for 1000 members (GOAL), using 10 BARS, it will show: [5 animated emojis][5 static emojis] representing 50% progress. The progress bar automatically adjusts for any values: e.g., 750/1000 members would show [7 animated emojis][3 static emojis] for 75% progress. IMPORTANT: The variable will not work correctly if you don't update the emoji character counts (27 and 26) with your own emoji lengths. Works with any custom Discord emojis - both animated (:a:) and static (:) formats.\n\n
